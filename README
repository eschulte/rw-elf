A simple library for the manipulation of extant elf files

Files:
    elf.h | defines the API
    elf.c | implementation, works on both 32- and 64-bit systems
  hello.c | example file used by "make check"
 rw-elf.c | demonstrates a simple application, changing the bytes of
          | the .text section of an existing elf file

Running:
       make | builds all object files and the rw-elf executable
 make check | runs rw-elf over hello creating hello2 which has a
            | modified .text section but is still functional
